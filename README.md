### What I learned

- Media Queries: 
- - Having the ability to change the style of the page based on the device viewing it is very powerful.
```css
    @media 
```
- CSS:
- - While I didn't learn anything new in this lantguage, getting more parctice with it was enjoyable.
- - Also: normalize.css is an awesome tool!
